            Below is the output of the traditional "hello world" application written in Pivot:
        </p>

        </application>

        <p>
            This version of the application was written entirely in Java and is shown below; a WTKX
            implementation is demonstrated next:

        <p>
            The program demonstrates some of the fundamental features of the Pivot platform: the
            <tt>Application</tt> interface, the <tt>Window</tt> class, and styles.
        </p>

        <h3>The Application Interface</h3>
        <p>
            The Application interface is the entry point into a Pivot application. It is similar to
            the <tt>main()</tt> method used in C and Java programming or the lifecycle methods used
            in traditional Java applet development. It defines the following four methods:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <tt>startup()</tt> - called when an application is starting up
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>shutdown()</tt> - called when a running application is shutting down
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>suspend()</tt> - called when an application is temporarily deactivated
            </li>
            <li>
                <tt>resume()</tt> - called when a suspended application is resumed
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            However, unlike <tt>main()</tt> or the applet lifecycle methods, which require a
            separate code base for each environment, <tt>Application</tt> defines a single
            interface that is used for both web deployment or desktop execution, allowing the same
            program to run unmodified in either environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            A Pivot application can be run in the browser using the <tt>&lt;applet&gt;</tt> tag, as
            shown below; the class name of the Pivot application is specified by the
            "applicationClassName" applet parameter (see
            <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/deployment_advice.html#deplToolkit">this article</a>
            for more information on how to deploy Java applets):
        </p>

        <source type="html">
            <![CDATA[
            <applet code="org.apache.pivot.wtk.BrowserApplicationContext$HostApplet"
                archive="lib/pivot-core-[version].jar,lib/pivot-wtk-[version].jar,lib/pivot-wtk-terra-[version].jar,lib/pivot-tutorials-[version].jar"
                width="160" height="80">
                <param name="applicationClassName" value="org.apache.pivot.tutorials.HelloJava">
            </applet>
            ]]>
        </source>

        <p>
            The same application can be run from the command line using the following syntax (minus
            the line breaks) on UNIX-based systems; the class name is the first argument to the
            DesktopApplicationContext loader application:
        </p>

        <p>
            <tt>java -cp pivot-core-<i>[version]</i>.jar:pivot-wtk-<i>[version]</i>.jar:
            pivot-wtk-terra-<i>[version]</i>.jar:pivot-tutorials-<i>[version]</i>.jar
            org.apache.pivot.wtk.DesktopApplicationContext org.apache.pivot.tutorials.HelloJava</tt>
        </p>

        <p>
            and the following on Windows systems:
        </p>

        <p>
            <tt>java -cp pivot-core-<i>[version]</i>.jar;pivot-wtk-<i>[version]</i>.jar;
            pivot-wtk-terra-<i>[version]</i>.jar;pivot-tutorials-<i>[version]</i>.jar
            org.apache.pivot.wtk.DesktopApplicationContext org.apache.pivot.tutorials.HelloJava</tt>
        </p>

        <p>
            The application itself defines a convenience <tt>main()</tt> method that delegates to
            <tt>DesktopApplicationContext.main()</tt>; this allows Pivot applications to be bundled
            as executable JARs and makes launching applications from within an IDE easier.
        </p>

        <h3>The Window Class</h3>
        <p>
            A window is the top-level entry point into an application's user interface. Almost all
            Pivot applications will use at least one window.
        </p>

        <p>
            The window in the sample application is an instance of <tt>Window</tt>, the most basic
            window type. It is simply an undecorated area of the screen into which other components
            may be placed. Other window types, such as <tt>Dialog</tt> and <tt>Frame</tt>, add
            additional features and behaviors such as title bars and modality.
        </p>

        <p>
            The window used by "Hello World" is "maximized": it automatically fills the entire area
            of the display. A maximized, decorationless window is commonly used as a top-level
            application window, particularly for applications that will be primarily run in a web
            browser. However, windows can also be given an explicit size, can be resized by the
            user, or can take on the default size of their content. Windows are discussed in more
            detail in the <a href="windows.html">Windows</a> section.
        </p>

        <h3>Styles</h3>
        <p>
            Styles are a means of customizing a component's appearance. Style properties are
            defined by a component's skin and are accessed via a component's styles collection. For
            example, the example application sets the font, color, and alignment styles on the
            "Hello World" label. Though skins are not required to provide styling support, most
            will provide similar capabilities.
