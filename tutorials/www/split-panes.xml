    <body>
        <p>
            Split panes provide a draggable divider, known as a "splitter", between two components,
            allowing a user to dynamically change the size of each component. The location of the
            splitter is expressed in terms of a percentage value (<tt>0.0</tt> to <tt>1.0</tt>)
            called the "split ratio", which determines how much space is allocated to each
            component.
        </p>

        <p>
            Split panes also have an orientation, which dictates whether the two components sit
            side by side or one on top of another. A horizontally oriented split pane has a left
            region and a right region; a vertically oriented split pane has a top region and a
            bottom region. Since orientation is a runtime property of <tt>SplitPane</tt>, the
            regions are referred to generically as the "top/left" region and the "bottom/right"
            region and are specified using the <tt>SplitPane.Region</tt> enum.
        </p>

        <p>
            When a split pane is resized, the caller can control how the change should affect the
            sizes of the two components by setting the split pane's "resize mode" and its "primary
            region". The resize mode can be set to either maintain the existing split ratio
            (allocate space according to existing allocation percentages) or to maintain the
            existing size of the primary region.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, a split pane may be locked, which will prevent the user from dragging the
            splitter. Note that callers will still be able to programatically adjust the split
            ratio.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following example shows a simple split pane that can be used to control the scale
            of an image view. You can change the orientation of the split pane by using the
            associated radio buttons. It also highlights the "useShadow" style, which is one of the
            styles supported by the Terra there's implementation of the split pane skin.
